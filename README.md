# test-plugin-12-st

Welcome to the test-plugin-12-st plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Software Template_

## Getting started

Your sample frontend plugin has been created, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/test-plugin-12-st](http://localhost:3000/test-plugin-12-st).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
